# Hi! I'm Jae! ğŸ‘‹

### ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a freshman student at Georgia Southern University!
### ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m double majoring in Computer Science and Software Engineering, with a concentration in Game Development! :)
### ğŸ‘¯ On campus, I work as a Peer Tutor and a Southern Ambassador (aka a tour guide :P)

### ğŸ¤” I'm hoping to learn more within the Software Engineering field, as much as I can on my own!
### ğŸ˜„ I always advocate for women in technology, as I am the President and Founder of our university's Girls Who Code charter, where we teach any women or non-binary person how to code!
### ğŸ’¬ Ask me about digital equity, new tech, and gaming!

### ğŸ“« You can reach me just about anywhere! (Linkedin, Handshake, Github, etc!) 

#### âš¡ Fun Fact: I have been vegetarian for a solid 5 years!
